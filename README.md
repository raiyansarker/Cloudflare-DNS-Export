# Cloudflare DNS Export

This action uses Cloudflare API to get DNS details and saves it in a `txt` file.

## Example usage

```
name: Test

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "*/5 * * * *"

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Backup
        uses: raiyansarker/cloudflare-dns-export@v1
        with:
          NAME: ${{ github.repository }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          ZONE_ID: ${{secrets.ZONE_ID}}
          API_KEY: ${{secrets.API_KEY}}
          FOLDER: backup
          PREFIX: raiyansarker.com
```

This action is fairly easy to setup. This only requires two information. One is `ZONE_ID` which you can find on the dashboard of your domain in Cloudflare.

And you need to get `API_KEY` that does have DNS management permissions. In order to get API key, [Click Here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). Then click on create token and use the "Edit zone DNS" template.

## Inputs

### `NAME`

**Required** Full name of your repository. You can dynamically set it by using `${{ github.repository }}` or you can manually write it in this format `username/repository_name`, e.g. `raiyansarker/cloudflare-dns-export`

### `GITHUB_TOKEN`

**Required** Temporary Github token. Type `${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}`. Github would automatically add one for you.

### `ZONE_ID`

**Required** ZONE_ID of your Cloudflare domain.

### `API_KEY`

**Required** Cloudflare API_KEY with at least DNS management permissions

### `FOLDER`

**Not-Required** The folder that you want to store DNS backup data. By Default - `DNS`

### `PREFIX`

**Not-Required** Prefix of the file name you want to save as, e.g. example.com. It would save files as `example.com - 13/09/2021 - 20-21-06.txt (PREFIX - DATE - TIME.txt)`. By Default - `example.com`

## Outputs

This won't be exactly same for your domain. A lot of information is hidden for security
